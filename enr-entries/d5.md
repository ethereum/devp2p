# The "d5" ENR entry

This specification defines the "d5" ENR entry, which provides information
about the [Node Discovery v5] protocol support of a node.

## Entry Format

    entry-key   = "d5"
    entry-value = [ version ]

At this time, the entry contains an RLP list with one element, the highest supported
discv5 version.

In order to be compatible with future versions of this specifications, implementations
should ignore any additional list elements in `entry-value`.
